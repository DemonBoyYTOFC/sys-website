About this Repository
A website with an APK form too
The APK is an offline version for use, and the web version is also under development.
Lore
One day, I had an idea to create an app and site for animes (like Anibunker or Crunchyroll), but my version is offline in an APK (free version, like). I don't get monetized like that, but if I can get some views, it's like gold.
Objectives
 * Visual Edition
 * Animes (videos and thumbnails)
 * Credits of the videos and others.
Credits of somethings
Anibunker
I'm learning the ropes:
 * HTML
 * C++
List of the stages of the project
 * [ ] Implement the Background
 * [ ] Create the Aesthetics
 * [ ] Make/Add Animes by categories
   etc...
I'll put something here.
| Animes | Mangas |

I'll detail more later.
